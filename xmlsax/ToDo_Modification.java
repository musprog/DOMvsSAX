 * because its event-driven model, SAX like any I/O streams useful only for
 * reading. To modify XML documents Domain Object Model (DOM) is required, due
 * to its larger memory usage and structure , DOM allow application to access
 * multiple data and not only serial access. DOM provides us a complete CRUD
 * functions to modify your XML document.
